## Project Details

AllDrafts is a cloud-based editor designed specifically for contracts, agreements, and other legal documents. The project involved creating a series of tutorials and marketing videos to showcase the features of the platform. I was in charge of the full production process, from scriptwriting to editing. I created motion graphics using Apple Motion and edited the videos using Final Cut Pro. I also recorded the voiceover using the SHURE Motiv Recording App and edited the audio using Ocenaudio. The videos were then uploaded to the AllDrafts website, where they are available for viewing.
